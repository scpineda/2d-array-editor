# 2D Array Editor

This program was made in computer science class.

The user starts out with a file of any name. The one provided is "file.txt" that has the number of rows and columns in the first line. Then, the program reads in the numbers to create a two dimensional array created with pointers. 

The user can input the file using the command line with argc and argv OR manually input the file name themselves within the program.

The array can be edited in different ways, such as randomizing every number and changing different numbers.
